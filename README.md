3D Printable Weather Forecasting Theatre | ESP32 &amp; OpenWeatherMap

Meet WeatherBot, my WiFi connected weather forecasting machine. WeatherBot retrieves a local forecast from OpenWeatherMaps and then shows you tomorrows weather with a motorised mini diorama.

The additional e-ink display provides a more precise insight into today and tomorrows weather patterns. I’ll show you step by step how to make your own. 

I have written and created a video containing full build instrucitons and a guide on using this code on my website: https://www.diymachines.co.uk/weatherbot-3d-printable-weather-forecasting-theatre
